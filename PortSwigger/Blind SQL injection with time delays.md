# Blind SQL injection with time delays
<hr><br>

### <u>Level:</u> Practioner
<br><br>
This lab is to check if the application is vulnerable to time delays. <br><br>
This site has no changes whatsoever depending on errors or other sorts of injection like with the previous labs. But the aim is to try to make it load 10 seconds later. This will show that it is indeed vulnerable. <br> <br>

It took the site close to 10 seconds to load as we had injected a delay into the query. <br><br>
With this the lab is solved. ✔️
