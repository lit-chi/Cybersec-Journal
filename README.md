# Cybersec-Journal

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Journal!!!

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of cybersecurity challenges, including Capture The Flag (CTF) problems, Labs, and other hands-on exercises I have completed during my learning journey.

The purpose of this journal is to track my progress, reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned, and help me build a consistent problem-solving routine in the field of cybersecurity.

    Note: Many of these challenges were solved with the help of online resources, writeups, and community
     forums as part of the learning process.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Each challenge or lab is represented by a folder named after the platform or challenge. Inside each folder, you'll typically find:

- **Methodology:** A step-by-step breakdown of my approach and thought process.
- **Images:** Screenshots or visuals to support each step of the solution.
- **Flag/Outcome:** The final result or flag captured (if applicable).

Feel free to explore the solutions and techniques I've documented.
